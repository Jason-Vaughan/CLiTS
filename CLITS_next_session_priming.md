# CLiTS Project Session Priming

## Project Context
- CLiTS (Chrome Log Inspector & Troubleshooting System) is a debugging tool framework
- Current version: 1.0.3
- Purpose: Assist AI assistants in closed-loop debugging processes
- Used by projects like OnDeck for debugging web applications

## Current Task
Implementing improvements based on OnDeck's feedback, organized into phases, which the AI Assitant is mandatory to check off as each piece is completed to keep track in case of a crash:

### Phase 1 - Critical Issues (Completed)
- [x] Module Path Resolution
  - [x] Fix "Cannot find module" error
  - [x] Implement consistent path handling
  - [x] Add better error messages
- [x] Browser Connection Stability
  - [x] Improve Chrome crash handling
  - [x] Add automatic reconnection
  - [x] Handle multiple Chrome instances
- [x] Error Handling
  - [x] Fix toLowerCase errors
  - [x] Add better error recovery
  - [x] Improve error reporting

### Phase 2 - Core Feature Enhancements (In Progress)
- [ ] Advanced Logging
  - [ ] Structured logging with metadata
  - [ ] Log rotation and size management
  - [ ] Timestamp synchronization
- [ ] Component Monitoring
  - [ ] React hooks monitoring
  - [ ] Component lifecycle tracking
  - [ ] Prop change monitoring
- [ ] Network Analysis
  - [ ] Request/response correlation
  - [ ] WebSocket tracking

  - [ ] React render metrics
  - [ ] Memory usage tracking
  - [ ] Event loop monitoring
- [ ] UI Interaction
  - [ ] User interaction recording
  - [ ] DOM mutation tracking
  - [ ] CSS change monitoring

### Phase 4 - Integration & Security (Pending)
- [ ] Development Workflow
  - [ ] Test integration
  - [ ] CI/CD improvements
  - [ ] Headless mode
- [ ] Security
  - [ ] Token handling
  - [ ] Credential management
  - [ ] Audit logging

### Phase 5 - Usability & Documentation (Pending)
- [ ] CLI Improvements
  - [ ] Interactive mode
  - [ ] Better help system
  - [ ] Command completion
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Quick start guide
  - [ ] API documentation
  - [ ] Troubleshooting guides
  - [ ] Best practices

## Session Notes
- Last completed task: Initial setup of improvement tracking and session priming
- Current focus: Phase 1 - Critical Issues, specifically Module Path Resolution
- Next steps: Begin implementation of path resolution fixes, starting with CLI path handling
- Blockers: None identified yet

## Compute Requirements
- Recommended: High
- Reasoning: 
  1. Complex TypeScript compilation
  2. Multiple Chrome instances handling
  3. Real-time log processing
  4. State management and visualization
  5. Performance monitoring
  6. Network analysis
  7. DOM mutation tracking
