## Session Notes
- **MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT**: Implemented hierarchical navigation with left/right arrow keys for DOM level traversal
- **MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT**: Fixed CDP Input domain compatibility issues by removing invalid Input.enable() calls
- **MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT**: Enhanced Material-UI class filtering with comprehensive regex pattern blocking
- Current focus: Debugging "no navigable elements" issue in buildElementHierarchy function
- Next steps: Fix element detection logic and test with real OnDeck application

## Next Session Focus
- **Main Task**: Fix "no navigable elements" issue in hierarchical navigation
- **Current Progress**: Hierarchical navigation UI implemented but element detection failing
- **Starting Point**: Debug buildElementHierarchy() function and CDP element extraction
- **Testing Status**: Chrome Remote Control launches but finds no elements to navigate

## Current Progress - THIS SESSION
- [x] **IMPLEMENTED Hierarchical Navigation**:
  - [x] **NEW**: Added `buildElementHierarchy()` function to analyze DOM depth of interactive elements
  - [x] **NEW**: Implemented level-based filtering with `currentLevel` tracking in chromeRemoteControl()
  - [x] **NEW**: Added `level_up` and `level_down` navigation options with ←→ arrow key hints
  - [x] **NEW**: Created smart level shifting to make most populated level become level 0
  - [x] **NEW**: Enhanced UI with level indicators and navigation hints
  - [x] **NEW**: Added level distribution logging for debugging
  - [x] **NEW**: Implemented comprehensive element description system with emoji prefixes
  - [x] **NEW**: Added priority-based selector generation (data-testid > aria-label > id > classes)

- [x] **FIXED CDP Input Domain Issues**:
  - [x] **FIXED**: Removed `Input.enable()` calls that were causing "Input.enable is not a function" errors
  - [x] **FIXED**: Added comments explaining Input domain is ready immediately
  - [x] **FIXED**: Updated error handling to work without Input domain initialization

- [x] **ENHANCED Material-UI Filtering**:
  - [x] **IMPROVED**: Implemented comprehensive regex pattern `/^[.]Mui[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*-root$/` to block ALL generic MUI root classes
  - [x] **IMPROVED**: Replaced individual class blocking with pattern-based approach
  - [x] **IMPROVED**: Maintained specific filtering for layout containers (.MuiBox-root, .MuiGrid-root, etc.)

- [x] **CODE CLEANUP**:
  - [x] **REMOVED**: Unused `extractLinksFromPage()` and `extractLinksFromCurrentChromePage()` functions
  - [x] **UPDATED**: Replaced old link-based navigation with hierarchy-based navigation
  - [x] **FIXED**: All linter errors resolved, build passing successfully

## Technical Issues Discovered This Session

### ✅ COMPLETED - Hierarchical Navigation Implementation
- **Element Hierarchy Analysis**: Successfully implemented DOM depth analysis
- **Level-Based Navigation**: Added left/right arrow navigation between hierarchy levels
- **Smart Level Distribution**: Automatic shifting to bring useful elements to level 0
- **Enhanced Element Descriptions**: Context-aware naming with parent element information
- **Priority Selector Generation**: Intelligent fallback from specific to generic selectors

### ✅ COMPLETED - CDP Input Domain Fix
- **Input.enable Error**: Completely resolved by removing unnecessary Input.enable() calls
- **CDP Domain Compatibility**: Input domain now works correctly without initialization
- **Element Interaction**: CDP errors during clicking resolved

### ❌ CURRENT ISSUE - Element Detection
- **No Navigable Elements**: buildElementHierarchy() returning empty array
- **CDP Connection**: May need debugging of Chrome Remote Interface connection
- **Element Extraction**: JavaScript evaluation in Chrome may be failing silently

### Next Session Priorities
1. **Debug buildElementHierarchy()**: Add logging to see what's happening in CDP evaluation
2. **Test Element Selectors**: Verify the complex CSS selector string is working in Chrome
3. **Fallback Strategies**: Implement simpler element detection if complex selectors fail
4. **OnDeck Testing**: Test with actual OnDeck application to verify fixes work in production

## Auto-Launch Chrome Fix (IMPORTANT FOR NEXT SESSION)
The user mentioned that earlier in the session, there was a fix that made the "launch tab to work when you fired it." This likely refers to the `launchChromeIfNeeded()` function in `src/cli-inspect.ts` lines 27-50 that:
- Automatically detects if Chrome is running with remote debugging on port 9222
- Auto-launches Chrome with proper debugging flags on macOS if not running
- Uses the command: `/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-debug --no-first-run --no-default-browser-check`

This auto-launch functionality should be working and may be key to resolving the "no navigable elements" issue.

## Compute Requirements
- Recommended: High
- Reasoning: 
  1. Complex TypeScript compilation
  2. Multiple Chrome instances handling
  3. Real-time log processing
  4. DOM hierarchy analysis
  5. Chrome DevTools Protocol debugging
  6. Material-UI class pattern matching
  7. Interactive navigation testing
