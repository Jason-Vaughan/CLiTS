# CLITS Next Session Priming

## Completed This Session
- Polished and expanded main README.md (intro, ToC, CLI docs, examples, contributing, etc.)
- Reviewed and updated example documentation for Node.js API and React app
- Audited project for files to include/exclude in npm publish
- Confirmed only compiled CLI and docs will be published (no source code, tests, or internal files)
- Planned manual cleanup of dist/ (remove test files, keep only what users need)

## Technical Notes
- `files` field in package.json ensures only dist/, README.md, and LICENSE are published
- AI assistants and users can run CLITS directly via CLI (wizard is optional)
- All usage and integration info is in the README and CLI help output

## Next Steps
- Manually remove test files and unnecessary content from dist/ before publishing
- Double-check project root for any files that should not be published
- Final review of documentation and CLI usability
- Prepare for npm publish

## Main Task for Next Session
Manual cleanup of dist/ and project root to ensure only necessary files are published. Final pre-publish review.
