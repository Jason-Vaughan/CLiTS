# CLiTS Project Session Priming

## Project Context
- CLiTS (Chrome Log Inspector & Troubleshooting System) is a debugging tool framework
- Current version: 1.0.3
- Purpose: Assist AI assistants in closed-loop debugging processes
- Used by projects like OnDeck for debugging web applications

## Current Task

  - [x] Improve Chrome crash handling
  - [x] Add automatic reconnection
  - [x] Handle multiple Chrome instances
- [x] Error Handling
  - [x] Fix toLowerCase errors
  - [x] Add better error recovery
  - [x] Improve error reporting

### Phase 2 - Core Feature Enhancements (In Progress)

  - [x] Memory usage tracking
  - [x] Event loop monitoring
- [x] UI Interaction
  - [x] User interaction recording
  - [x] DOM mutation tracking
  - [x] CSS change monitoring

### Phase 4 - Integration & Security (Pending)
- [x] Development Workflow
  - [x] Test integration
  - [x] CI/CD improvements
  - [x] Headless mode
- [x] Security
  - [x] Token handling
  - [x] Credential management
  - [x] Audit logging
  - [x] Data protection
- [x] UI Interaction

  - [x] CSS change monitoring

### Phase 5 - Usability & Documentation (Pending)
- [x] CLI Improvements
  - [x] Interactive mode
  - [x] Better help system
  - [x] Command completion
- [x] Documentation
  - [x] Quick start guide
  - [x] API documentation
  - [x] Troubleshooting guides
  - [x] Best practices

## Session Notes
- Last completed task: Attempted to fix test failures in `src/__tests__/chrome-extractor.test.ts` by refining event injection and updating type definitions, but tests are still failing.
- Current focus: Resolving test failures to enable successful NPM package publication.
- Next steps: Continue debugging and fixing the failing tests, focusing on the exact content and type of `ExtractedLog` and `CollectedLogEntry` objects, and ensuring the `formatLogs` method correctly processes and populates the `content` property for all new log types. Verify that `ChromeErrorHandler.executeWithRetry` is not inadvertently suppressing or modifying errors that should cause test failures.
- Blockers: Failing tests preventing NPM publish.

## Next Session Focus
- Main Task: Fix remaining linter errors in `src/__tests__/chrome-extractor.test.ts`
- Current Progress: Identified two main issues:
  1. ConsoleMessage type requires proper `source` property definition
  2. Unused imports (PlatformErrorHandler and ChromeErrorHandler) need to be addressed
- Starting Point: Continue from the current state of `src/__tests__/chrome-extractor.test.ts` with focus on type definitions and import cleanup

## Current Progress
- [x] Identified specific linter errors in test file
- [x] Attempted initial fixes for type definitions
- [ ] Fix ConsoleMessage type definition
- [ ] Clean up unused imports
- [ ] Verify all test cases are properly typed
- [ ] Ensure test file passes all linter checks
- [ ] Complete NPM package publication process

## Compute Requirements
- Recommended: High
- Reasoning: 
  1. Complex TypeScript compilation
  2. Multiple Chrome instances handling
  3. Real-time log processing
  4. State management and visualization
  5. Performance monitoring
  6. Network analysis
  7. DOM mutation tracking
