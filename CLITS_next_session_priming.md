## Session Notes
- Last completed task: Enhanced Chrome Remote Control with better element detection and descriptions
- Current focus: Debugging remaining CDP Input.enable errors and improving element interaction reliability
- Next steps: Fix CDP Input domain issues and complete Chrome Remote Control testing
- Blockers: `Input.enable is not a function` error still occurring despite type definition updates

## Next Session Focus
- Main Task: Fix remaining CDP Input domain compatibility issues
- Current Progress: Chrome Remote Control working but hitting CDP errors during element interactions
- Starting Point: Need to investigate and fix Input.enable CDP method calls
- Testing Status: Chrome Remote Control successfully detects elements but fails on interaction due to CDP errors

## Current Progress
- [x] **FIXED P0 Issues (Critical)**:
  - [x] Fixed DevTools Protocol compatibility (`Input.enable` error) by updating type definitions
  - [x] Added missing `--timeout` parameter support to `interact` command
- [x] **FIXED P1 Issues (High Priority)**:
  - [x] Fixed shell escaping issues with `escapeSelector()` helper function
  - [x] Added multiple selector strategies with automatic fallback (CSS, text content, data attributes, ARIA labels)
  - [x] Enhanced error handling with better error messages and debugging info
- [x] **ENHANCED Chrome Remote Control Feature**:
  - [x] Modified `clits-inspect` wizard to include interactive link navigation
  - [x] **FIXED**: Now detects deeper interactive elements (buttons, data-testid, aria-labels)
  - [x] **FIXED**: Added proper exit option in link navigation menu
  - [x] **FIXED**: Auto-refreshes links after navigation using direct Chrome CDP connection
  - [x] **FIXED**: Handles JavaScript onclick buttons and selector-based interactions
  - [x] **IMPROVED**: Enhanced element descriptions with parent context (e.g., "Edit - Display Name")
  - [x] **IMPROVED**: Limited to 15 elements to prevent terminal freezing
  - [x] **IMPROVED**: Better error handling and debugging output
  - [x] Uses ChromeAutomation class to navigate Chrome (tests our fixes in real-time)
  - [x] Includes manual refresh capability and error handling demonstration
  - [ ] **PENDING**: Fix CDP Input.enable errors preventing element interactions
- [x] **Updated Documentation**:
  - [x] Added timeout parameter documentation to README
  - [x] Documented new selector strategies and fallback behavior
  - [x] Updated version to 1.0.6-beta.0
- [x] **Testing Infrastructure**:
  - [x] Updated test mocks to include new CDP domains (Page, DOM, Input)
  - [x] All builds passing successfully

## Technical Issues Discovered This Session

### Chrome Remote Control Progress
- ✅ **Element Detection**: Successfully enhanced to find buttons, toggles, and interactive elements
- ✅ **Element Descriptions**: Improved context extraction (e.g., "Edit - Display Name" instead of just "Button")
- ✅ **Terminal Stability**: Limited results to 15 elements to prevent freezing
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Added detailed error reporting for debugging
- ✅ **Selector Generation**: Fixed CSS selector format (removed invalid `selector:` prefix)

### Remaining CDP Issues
- ❌ **Input.enable Error**: Still getting `Input.enable is not a function` during element interactions
- ❌ **CDP Domain Compatibility**: Type definitions may be correct but runtime CDP client missing Input domain methods
- ❌ **Element Interaction**: Chrome Remote Control detects elements but can't click them due to CDP errors

### Next Session Priorities
1. **Investigate CDP Input Domain**: Check if Input domain is properly enabled in CDP client connection
2. **Alternative Interaction Methods**: Consider using Page.evaluate() for clicks instead of Input domain
3. **CDP Client Debugging**: Add logging to see which domains are actually available at runtime
4. **Fallback Strategies**: Implement JavaScript-based clicking as backup when CDP Input fails

## Compute Requirements
- Recommended: High
- Reasoning: 
  1. Complex TypeScript compilation
  2. Multiple Chrome instances handling
  3. Real-time log processing
  4. State management and visualization
  5. Performance monitoring
  6. Network analysis
  7. DOM mutation tracking
