# CLITS Session Status

## Current Progress
- Identified CI/CD test failures across Node.js versions (16.x, 18.x, 20.x)
- Made initial fixes to test configuration:
  - Updated Vitest config with proper timeouts and fork pool settings
  - Improved async handling in chrome-extractor.test.ts
  - Simplified GitHub Actions workflow
- Tests are still failing in CI environment despite local success

## Last Session's Work
- Investigated and fixed hardcoded port 9222 concerns
- Confirmed port configurability through --chrome-port CLI option
- Started addressing CI/CD test failures
- Made initial test configuration improvements

## Next Session Starting Point
1. Continue debugging CI test failures:
   - Review CI logs for specific error patterns
   - Check for environment-specific issues in Node.js 16.x, 18.x, and 20.x
   - Consider adding more detailed test logging
   - Investigate potential race conditions in async tests

2. Potential Areas to Investigate:
   - Test environment differences between local and CI
   - Mock cleanup and timing issues
   - Node.js version compatibility
   - Memory usage and garbage collection
   - Test isolation and side effects

3. Action Items for Next Session:
   - Add more detailed error logging to tests
   - Review test setup/teardown procedures
   - Consider adding test retries for flaky tests
   - Investigate test parallelization issues
   - Add CI-specific test configuration if needed

## Technical Notes
- Current test setup uses Vitest with timer mocks
- Tests are running in forked mode with 30s timeout
- Chrome extractor tests heavily rely on CDP mocking
- Local tests pass but CI environment shows consistent failures

## Dependencies and Environment
- Node.js versions: 16.x, 18.x, 20.x
- Test framework: Vitest
- Key dependencies: chrome-remote-interface, node-fetch
- CI environment: GitHub Actions (ubuntu-latest)

## Known Issues
- Tests failing in CI with exit code 1
- Possible async timing issues in tests
- Potential memory/resource cleanup problems
- Need to verify mock cleanup in all test cases
