# CLiTS Session Progress and Next Steps

## Session Summary (Last Updated: Current)

### Completed Work
- Fixed TypeScript linting errors in test files
- Created and implemented type definitions:
  - src/types/chrome-types.d.ts
  - src/types/report.d.ts
  - src/types/extractor.d.ts
  - src/types/chrome-remote-interface.d.ts
- Updated tsconfig.json with proper module resolution and synthetic imports
- Enhanced test file type safety in chrome-extractor.test.ts
- Implemented proper type definitions for CDP client and mock interfaces

### Current State
- Most TypeScript errors have been resolved
- Remaining linter issues in chrome-extractor.test.ts:
  1. Triple slash reference directive for vitest
  2. Unused SpyInstance import
  3. CDPClient module export and synthetic default import warnings

### Next Session Starting Point
The next session should focus on:
1. Resolving remaining linter warnings in chrome-extractor.test.ts:
   - Replace triple slash reference with proper vitest import
   - Clean up unused imports
   - Fix CDPClient module export issues
2. Comprehensive testing of the type system changes
3. Verification of test coverage and functionality

### Technical Notes
- The project now has proper type definitions for Chrome DevTools Protocol
- Test mocks are properly typed with ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>
- tsconfig.json includes allowSyntheticDefaultImports
- Type definitions are properly organized in src/types/

### Dependencies and Environment
- TypeScript 5.3.3
- Vitest 1.6.1
- Chrome Remote Interface 0.33.3
- Node.js >= 16

### Next Steps
1. [ ] Clean up vitest imports and references
2. [ ] Resolve CDPClient module export warnings
3. [ ] Remove unused imports and declarations
4. [ ] Run full test suite to verify changes
5. [ ] Update documentation if needed

### Open Questions
- Should we consider moving to a different testing framework to avoid triple-slash references?
- Do we need to enhance the mock types further for better test coverage?

## Current Session Summary (Date: 2025-06-05)

### Completed Tasks
1. Fixed GitHub authentication issues
   - Removed exposed token from git remote URL
   - Configured git to use macOS keychain for secure credential storage
   - Updated remote URL with correct case-sensitive repository name (CLiTS)

2. Resolved CI/CD Issues
   - Fixed Node.js version compatibility issues
   - Updated Vitest and related dependencies to compatible versions:
     - Upgraded vitest to ^1.2.1
     - Replaced deprecated @vitest/coverage-c8 with @vitest/coverage-v8
     - Updated @vitest/ui to match version ^1.2.1

### Current State
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline is now running with proper authentication
- Test suite runs successfully in Node.js environments
- Dependencies are updated to latest compatible versions

### Known Issues
1. NPM Package Updates Required
   - Recent dependency updates (vitest and coverage tools) need to be reflected in the published npm package
   - Need to verify if these changes affect the public API or testing capabilities

### Next Session Tasks
1. NPM Package Management
   - [ ] Review package.json version bump requirements
   - [ ] Test the package locally before publishing
   - [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with recent changes
   - [ ] Prepare npm publish with new version

2. Documentation Updates
   - [ ] Update testing documentation to reflect new vitest configuration
   - [ ] Document any changes in test coverage reporting
   - [ ] Review and update CI/CD documentation

3. Verification Tasks
   - [ ] Verify test coverage reports work with new @vitest/coverage-v8
   - [ ] Test package installation and usage in a fresh project
   - [ ] Ensure CI pipeline maintains consistent behavior across Node.js versions

### Notes for Next Session
- The switch from coverage-c8 to coverage-v8 might require updates to coverage configuration
- Consider adding test coverage thresholds in CI pipeline
- May need to update test scripts in package.json to reflect new coverage tool

### Environment Details
- Node.js versions tested: 16.x, 18.x, 20.x
- Current package version: 1.0.3
- Development OS: macOS (darwin 24.3.0)
