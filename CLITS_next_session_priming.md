# CLITS Next Session Priming

## Session Wrap-up (June 2024)

### What We Accomplished
- Built a robust, user-friendly CLI for Chrome inspection on macOS
- Auto-launches Chrome with remote debugging if not running
- Handles login pauses with Enter/timeout prompt
- Lets user select browser tab if multiple are open
- Captures all console, network, and DOM info for any website
- Output is AI-assistant friendly and ready for NPM distribution

### Next Steps
- Polish documentation and add usage tips for new users and AI assistants
- Add more CLI options (e.g., headless mode, log filtering, output to file)
- Implement user profiles or session saving for repeat inspections
- Prepare for publishing to NPM (version, keywords, README polish)
- Consider more advanced features (project config, bug reporting, improvement suggestions)
