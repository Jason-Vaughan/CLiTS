# SESSION WRAP: CLiTS v1.0.7-beta.0 NPM Publishing Verification

**Session Date**: June 8th, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0.7-beta.0  
**Session Focus**: NPM Publishing Verification & Dashboard Investigation  

## Session Overview

This session focused on verifying the successful publication of CLiTS v1.0.7-beta.0 to NPM and investigating why the new version wasn't immediately visible on the NPM dashboard.

## User Concern

User noticed that the NPM packages dashboard was showing v1.0.6-beta.6 instead of the newly published v1.0.7-beta.0, leading to concerns about:
- Whether the package was published as private
- Package accessibility for CissorCLITS integration
- General NPM publication status

## Investigation & Resolution

### 1. Package Verification
**Tool Used**: `npm info @puberty-labs/clits@1.0.7-beta.0`

**Results**:
- ✅ Package is **PUBLIC** (not private)
- ✅ Version 1.0.7-beta.0 is successfully published
- ✅ Published 4 minutes before verification
- ✅ Accessible via `npm install @puberty-labs/clits@beta`

### 2. Tag Structure Analysis
**Current NPM Tags**:
```
dist-tags:
beta: 1.0.7-beta.0    latest: 1.0.6-beta.6
```

### 3. Installation Verification
**Tool Used**: `npm install @puberty-labs/clits@beta --dry-run`

**Results**:
- ✅ Package installs successfully
- ✅ Would upgrade from 1.0.4-beta.0 → 1.0.7-beta.0
- ✅ All dependencies resolve correctly

## Root Cause Analysis

### NPM Dashboard Behavior
The NPM website dashboard displays the **"latest"** tagged version by default. Since we published with `--tag beta`:
- The new version is tagged as `beta: 1.0.7-beta.0`
- The `latest` tag remains at `1.0.6-beta.6`
- Dashboard shows the "latest" tag version, not the most recent publication

This is **expected behavior** for beta releases.

## Technical Details

### Package Information
- **Package Name**: @puberty-labs/clits
- **Published Version**: 1.0.7-beta.0
- **Tag**: beta
- **Size**: 775.7 kB unpacked
- **Dependencies**: 16 packages

### Installation Commands
For users wanting the latest beta features:
```bash
npm install @puberty-labs/clits@beta

For users wanting the stable version:

npm install @puberty-labs/clits@latest
```

## Key Findings

1. **Publication Successful**: v1.0.7-beta.0 is fully published and accessible
2. **NPM Dashboard Normal**: Showing "latest" tag (v1.0.6-beta.6) is expected behavior
3. **Public Accessibility**: Package can be installed by anyone using the beta tag
4. **CissorCLITS Ready**: Integration can proceed with confidence

## Session Outcome

✅ **Verified**: CLiTS v1.0.7-beta.0 is successfully published to NPM  
✅ **Confirmed**: Package is public and accessible  
✅ **Explained**: NPM dashboard behavior is normal for beta releases  
✅ **Ready**: CissorCLITS integration can proceed  

## Next Steps

1. **CissorCLITS Integration**: Use `@puberty-labs/clits@beta` for installation
2. **Future Releases**: Consider promoting to "latest" when ready for stable release
3. **Documentation**: Update integration guides with correct installation command
