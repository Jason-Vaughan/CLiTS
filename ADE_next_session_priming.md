## Next Session Tasks

**Primary Focus:** Enhance Chrome DevTools Protocol Integration

### Completed in Last Session
- [x] Set up testing infrastructure with Jest
- [x] Implemented basic file system log extraction
- [x] Added Winston for logging
- [x] Chrome DevTools Protocol integration:
  - [x] Created Chrome extractor module
  - [x] Added CDP client integration
  - [x] Fixed Chrome installation and permissions issues
  - [x] Updated CLI to support both file and Chrome extraction
  - [x] Successfully tested CDP integration
  - [x] Fixed timestamp handling for logs
  - [x] Added better error handling and debugging

### Next Steps
1. **Enhance Chrome DevTools Protocol Integration**
   - [ ] Add filtering options for Chrome logs
   - [ ] Add support for more CDP domains (Runtime, Security, etc.)
   - [ ] Add support for custom event listeners
   - [ ] Add support for custom log formatting
   - [ ] Add support for log persistence

2. **Improve Log Extraction**
   - [ ] Add filtering options for log types
   - [ ] Implement log format standardization
   - [ ] Add timestamp-based filtering
   - [ ] Add log level filtering

3. **Testing**
   - [ ] Add unit tests for Chrome log extraction
   - [ ] Add integration tests with Chrome
   - [ ] Add error case testing
   - [ ] Update test coverage

4. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Document Chrome debugging setup
   - [ ] Add usage examples with Chrome
   - [ ] Update CLI documentation
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

### Starting Point for Next Session
- Project has working file system log extraction
- Testing infrastructure is in place
- Chrome DevTools Protocol integration is working and tested
- Successfully capturing network and console logs
- Ready to enhance CDP functionality

## Context from Previous Sessions
- Tool is designed for extracting and sharing debugging data from AI and web projects
- Project is following ESM/NodeNext module system
- All development must remain within the AI-Debug-Extractor folder
- CLI tool is the primary deliverable
- Chrome integration uses CDP for reliable log extraction

## Current Progress
- [x] Project initialization and documentation
- [x] Git repo setup
- [x] Initial CLI code scaffolding
- [x] LICENSE file added
- [x] All linter/code hygiene issues resolved
- [x] Basic log extraction implementation
- [x] Testing infrastructure setup
- [x] Chrome log extraction (CDP approach working)
- [ ] Documentation updates needed for Chrome integration
