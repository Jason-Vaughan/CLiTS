- [x] Testing infrastructure setup
- [x] Chrome log extraction (CDP approach working)
- [x] Comprehensive test suite implemented
- [x] Documentation updates completed
- [x] Platform-specific error handling implemented
- [ ] Chrome-specific error handling needed
- [ ] Cross-platform testing needed
- [ ] Final validation pending

## Known Issues to Address
1. ~~macOS Task Policy Errors~~ (FIXED)
   ```
   ERROR:base/process/process_mac.cc:53] task_policy_set TASK_CATEGORY_POLICY: (os/kern) invalid argument
   ERROR:base/process/process_mac.cc:98] task_policy_set TASK_SUPPRESSION_POLICY: (os/kern) invalid argument
   ```

2. Chrome Registration Errors (NEXT PRIORITY):
   ```
   ERROR:google_apis/gcm/engine/registration_request.cc:291] Registration response error message: DEPRECATED_ENDPOINT
   ```

3. Performance Validation:
   - Need to verify streaming performance with large log files
   - Need to test high-frequency logging scenarios
   - Need to validate memory usage under load
