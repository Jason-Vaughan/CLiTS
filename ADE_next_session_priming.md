## Next Session Tasks

**Primary Focus:** Implement Basic Log Extraction and Testing Infrastructure

### Completed in Last Session
- [x] Finalized all linter fixes:
  - [x] Removed unused ora dependency and its related code
  - [x] Fixed package.json import in cli.ts for NodeNext/ESM compatibility
  - [x] Verified no DEFAULT_TEMPLATE present in report.ts
  - [x] Ran linter to confirm all fixes
- [x] Enhanced README with detailed planned features and milestones checklist
  - [x] Added detailed sub-tasks for each phase
  - [x] Marked completed items in Phase 1
  - [x] Added more specific roadmap items

### Next Steps
1. **Implement Basic Log Extraction**
   - [ ] Design and implement file system log reading
   - [ ] Create log parsing and formatting logic
   - [ ] Add output generation functionality
   - [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
   - [ ] Add validation for input/output

2. **Package Management**
   - [ ] Add required dependencies for log parsing
   - [ ] Update TypeScript to resolve version warning
   - [ ] Review and update other dependencies if needed

3. **Testing Setup**
   - [ ] Set up testing framework
   - [ ] Add unit tests for CLI functionality
   - [ ] Add tests for log extraction features
   - [ ] Set up test coverage reporting

4. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Add JSDoc comments to existing code
   - [ ] Document extract command usage
   - [ ] Add examples for log extraction

### Starting Point for Next Session
- Project has clean code with all linter issues resolved
- Clear roadmap and milestones established in README
- Ready to begin implementation of log extraction feature
- Need to decide on testing framework and logging libraries

## Context from Previous Sessions
- Tool is designed for extracting and sharing debugging data from AI and web projects
- Project is following ESM/NodeNext module system
- All development must remain within the AI-Debug-Extractor folder
- CLI tool is the primary deliverable, with browser extension planned for future
- Session wrap-up and priming process is mandatory

## Current Progress
- [x] Project initialization and documentation
- [x] Git repo setup
- [x] Initial CLI code scaffolding
- [x] LICENSE file added
- [x] All linter/code hygiene issues resolved
- [x] Planned features/milestones checklist added to README
- [x] Session wrap-up and priming process established
- [ ] Basic log extraction implementation (Next major feature)
- [ ] Testing infrastructure setup (Next technical debt item)
